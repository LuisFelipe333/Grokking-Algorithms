# Grokking-Algorithms
Algorithms of the book Grokking Algorithms made in Java and C# and in the original language that the book uses, python


Algorithm complexity:

- Binary Search: O(log n)
- Selection Sort: O(n^2)
- Quick Sort: O(*n log n*) average
- Breadth-first Search: O(V + E)
- Dijkstra's Algorithm: O(V^2)

Glosary:

+ n : Number of elements
+ V : Number of vertices
+ E : Number of edges
